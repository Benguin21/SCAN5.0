                        <p>Stephen W. Gibson envisioned and started the SCAN project shortly after his surgery in late 2018. Steve's surgery was the result of several mentions by his hairdresser that he had a suspicious area on his scalp. After several promptings from his hairdresser Steve had his scalp checked by a dermatologist. Steve received a call soon after his appointment Steve was called back into his doctors office and was informed that he had melanoma on his scalp. After a biopsy, the melanoma cancer was removed.</p>
                        <p>After doing a review of the literature on Melanoma, performing due diligence, and making phone calls, Stephen invited SUU to be the first university to pilot the program that we then called cancer awareness for hairdressers. This pilot was intended to train hairdressers and help increase their self efficacy so they would refer their clients to dermatologists like Steveâ€™s hairdresser. During the pilot SUU interns personally visited 83 hairdressers in their studios.</p>
                        <p>Stephen then invited Mark Hyde and in connection with UVU in December 2019 to be the second university to have interns visit hairdressers in their studios. The COVID-19 pandemic prevented the visitation of hairdressers until the fall semester 2021. During this time 55 beauty professionals were certified despite the intense restrictions on the project.</p>
                        <p>Although a few visits were made, much other work has been completed, especially under Mary Brown and Mark Hyde's direction and with great help from Maelin during the time that no face-to-face visits could be made.</p>
                        <p> With great help from Mark Hyde and Maelin a grant was obtained for the SCAN project from the DPAF. I worked out the funding with the Foundation Director for UVU to be the first of possibly many grants for several other universities in Utah and universities in Oregon and Colorado as well as a return with Mary Brown's help to SUU and southern Utah.</p>
